TFileCopyNew

This is a newest enhanced release of TFileCopy.

New most features :

1) multifolder-multifiles copy
2) wild cards allowed on sourceFile and targetFile properties
3) full event-driven messaging on errors, copy progresses and overriding behaviors
4) the memo property is ready made to attach a TMemo component to trace copy events

A special thank to everybody wrote me suggestions and comments .
This new release has born from a great brain storm, thank's to everybody has contributed to it.
This release is the one I'm using this time and , I hope, it's the best compromise 
between enhanced features and simplicity of use.
